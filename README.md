Cobar Systems is a B2B service company that provides web-based software 
solutions in the field of continuity management and disaster recovery. Johann
Barlach and Casey Flynn founded Cobar Systems in October 2011 to innovate the
way organizations test their recovery strategies.

We sell a web-based management system for testing business continuity plans, 
ensuring preparedness of employees and answering the question for organizations
“Will our recovery plans work during a real business disruption?”. Our system,
called Themis, replaces email communication and excel-spreadsheet that are
currently used to manage business continuity testing. It automatically 
distributes, collects and compiles testing data across an organization and
tracks if requirements, set by compliance, are met. Engagement of test
participants is also improved through its mobile and tablet integration, which
allows them to access and input exercise information anytime, anywhere. Unlike
competitors, Themis is an application built solely for the purpose of improving
preparedness in organizations through exercising.

Cobar Systems's solutions are built with modern web technologies; allowing for
our product to load efficiently, remain responsive under high load conditions,
be cross-platform and browser compatible, feature real-time communication, and
be highly extensible/maintainable by developers.
